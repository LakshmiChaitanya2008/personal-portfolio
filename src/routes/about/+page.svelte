        I'm a {new Date().getFullYear() - 2008}-year-old developer from
        Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. I've been interested in computers since I
        was a kid. My brother was a software engineer, and I used to feel amazed
        watching him code websites and applications. That curiosity pushed me
        into programming early on.

        I started my journey with Java back in 7th grade, and from there I
        slowly picked up HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and many other
        technologies. I have been learning, coding and exploring the software
        industry since the last 5 years and never regretted choosing programming
        as a hobby.

        I enjoy solving problems and building things whenever I feel bored.
        Whenever I get an idea—big or small—I just build it with whatever tools
        I know. That’s pretty much why my GitHub is filled with random
        experimental projects, but each one taught me something new.
