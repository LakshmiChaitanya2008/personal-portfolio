        Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm a teenager from Andhra Pradesh, India, learning to code.
        I've built projects using React and Tailwind CSS. Currently, I'm
        focusing on full-stack web development with JavaScript. I entered the
        programming world at 12 and have a passion for learning more frontend
        and backend technologies. My other goal is to explore the world and
        nature! Excited to keep growing. I don't know why I created this site,
        but it's fun.
      </p>
